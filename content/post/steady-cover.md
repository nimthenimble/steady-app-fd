While the blog is still in building progress, which will probably be added on the **issue #4**. It'll explain on how the blog was built, and I can already say that in order to build it, the [Hugo Framework](https://gohugo.io) will be used.

I've designed with the use of [Canva](https://canva.com) a cover which can both be used in the LinkedIn and on the blog. It perfectly fits a user profile in LinkedIn, but does not adapt fully to company profiles as the cover width and height are smaller.
